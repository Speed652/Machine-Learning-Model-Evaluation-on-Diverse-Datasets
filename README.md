CP322 Machine Learning assignment 2
Due November 12th, 2023

In this mini-project, you will develop models to classify textual data, the input is text documents, and the output is categorical variables (class labels).

2 Datasets:
1- 20 news group
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html

2- IMDB reviews
https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

Instructions:
Apply and compare the performance of the following models:
• Logistic regression: sklearn.linear model.LogisticRegression
• Decision trees: sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
• Support vector machines: sklearn.svm.LinearSVC
• Ada boost: sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier
• Random forest: sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier

Develop a model validation pipeline (e.g., using k-fold cross-validation or a held-out validation set) and study the effect of different hyperparameters or design choices. In a single table, compare and report the performance of the above-mentioned models (with their best hyperparameters), and mark the winner for each dataset and overall.
